# Postmortem Report

**Issue Summary:**

-   **Duration:** February 18, 2024, 08:00 AM - 10:30 AM (UTC)
-   **Impact:** Temporary unavailability of our e-commerce platform; 20% of users experienced slow page loading and transaction failures.

**Timeline:**

-   **08:00 AM:** Issue detected by automated monitoring alerts showing increased response time.
-   **08:05 AM:** Engineering team notified of the slowdown via automated alert.
-   **08:15 AM:** Initial investigation started, focusing on database and server health.
-   **08:30 AM:** Assumed database overload due to increased traffic; scaling attempts initiated.
-   **09:00 AM:** No improvement observed; wrong assumption led to ineffective scaling measures.
-   **09:15 AM:** Issue escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
-   **09:30 AM:** Intensive analysis revealed a misconfigured caching layer causing database queries to bottleneck.
-   **10:00 AM:** Caching layer reconfiguration initiated.
-   **10:30 AM:** Web stack performance restored; platform functionality back to normal.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

-   **Root Cause:** Misconfigured caching layer resulted in a flood of unnecessary database queries, overwhelming the system.
-   **Resolution:** Caching layer reconfigured to filter and cache appropriate queries, reducing the load on the database and restoring normal performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

-   **Improvements/Fixes:**
    -   Strengthen monitoring to detect abnormal query patterns in real-time.
    -   Regularly review and update system configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
    -   Implement automated testing for caching layer configurations during deployment.
-   **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
    -   Implement stricter access controls for configuration changes to prevent accidental misconfigurations.
    -   Conduct a thorough review of existing caching mechanisms to identify and eliminate potential bottlenecks.
    -   Enhance documentation regarding system dependencies and configurations for better future troubleshooting.
    -   Schedule regular training sessions to keep the team updated on best practices for web stack maintenance and troubleshooting.
