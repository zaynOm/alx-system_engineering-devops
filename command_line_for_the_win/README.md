### The steps to use the SFTP command-line tool
1. Open a terminal on your local machine, and navigate to the directory where you have the screenshots.

2. Start a new sftp connection with the sandbox using the command `sftp username@hostname` or you can just copy it by cklicking on `SFTP` from the sandbox you want to use.

3. You should provide the sandbox password.

4. To upload the screenshots you use the command `put screenshot_name`.

5. Run `ls` to make sure all the screenshots were uploaded, then run `exit` to close the sftp connection.
